# rebalance.tf

This page is a personal project of mines to create a hub where balance ideas can be freely shared and feedback/discussions can be hosted over these proposals. From my experiences thus far, one of the biggest struggles for balance document authors is that they struggle with getting feedback, and the odd comment they get is often negative and discouraging. 

1. In this page, you may browse through existing balance documents, websites or mods I have collected.
2. You may comment and discuss balance write ups in the [discussions](https://github.com/EtherealTr/rebalancetf/discussions) section.
3. You may post your balance document by creating a post in [issues](https://github.com/EtherealTr/rebalancetf/discussions) or [pull requests](https://github.com/EtherealTr/rebalancetf/discussions), approved documents will be added into the page and be credited afterwards. Please ensure that you are available for contact by me (EtherealTr)!

Some facts on this project:
* This project started in December 2021, and as of 28th April 2023, I have collected 51 write ups across different websites, and met/talked with many balance authors and gradually expanded my views on balancing as well.
* Note: This project is not related in any shape or form to balance.tf on GitHub, which is a dropped project many years ago with a similar goal as mines
