# rebalance.tf

Page is still a massive WIP, please refer to [this link](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:EtherealT) for more information.

This page is a personal project of mines to create a hub where balance ideas can be freely shared and feedback/discussions can be hosted over these proposals. From my experiences thus far, one of the biggest struggles for balance document authors is that they struggle with getting feedback, and the odd comment they get is often negative and discouraging. 

1. In this page, you may browse through existing balance documents, websites or mods I have collected.
2. You may comment and discuss balance write ups in the [discussions](https://github.com/EtherealTr/rebalancetf/discussions) section.
3. You may post your balance document by creating a post in [issues](https://github.com/EtherealTr/rebalancetf/discussions) or [pull requests](https://github.com/EtherealTr/rebalancetf/discussions), approved documents will be added into the page and be credited afterwards. Please ensure that you are available for contact by me (EtherealTr)!

Some facts on this project:
* This project started in December 2021, and as of 30th August 2023, I have collected 61 write ups across different websites, and met/talked with many balance authors and gradually expanded my views on balancing as well.
* Note: This project is not related in any shape or form to balance.tf on GitHub, which is a dropped project many years ago with a similar goal as mines

# Future plans + Author's note

As there are rumors that the official tf2 wiki is going to be more strict in regulating user pages (my user page was once contested by someone else) and rules for excusing user pages aren't allowed, my end goal is to report over my existing work and turn this into a website where people can browse my work freely.

There are also some pages that would either contain vague information or be incomplete -- My apologies to all the readers ahead of time, getting every single author to cooperate and answer questions isn't entirely easy, from being accused of trying to steal information to the authors themselves having given up on their write ups and never wishing to go back to it, as well as simple skepticism in general. At the end of the day, we're all only human and all I can do is to try my best and archive people's work and balance takes to the best of my ability. 

In any case, I do hope whoever who spends time reading through these changes has a good time and can find useful and valuable information towards their balancing. 

Disclaimer: This is a non profit project lead by a single person for the most part, so donation links don't (and probably shouldn't) exist, but please contact me over at Discord or Reddit if you are willing to help out with my project in terms of proofreading and casual discussion.
